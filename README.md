# ZK-Port Inter-Chain Hub

ZK-Port is a **unified, privacy-preserving asset management and cross-chain transfer hub** designed to connect multiple blockchain ecosystems, including **Ethereum**, **Solana**, **Cosmos**, **Avalanche**, **Polygon** and **Polkadot** (and more). This project leverages the power of **Rust**, **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, and **cross-chain interoperability standards** (like IBC and XCMP) to create a scalable and trust-minimized multichain platform.

## Vision

ZK-Port aims to solve the fragmented multichain experience by:

- Aggregating fungible token balances from multiple chains in one seamless interface.
- Enabling private and secure cross-chain transfers with ZKPs, ensuring user balances or eligibility are proven without being fully revealed.
- Supporting multiple blockchain paradigms, including EVM-compatible chains, Substrate-based chains, and Solana.
- Showcasing the potential of **Rust** as the core programming language for multichain applications.

## Key Features

### 🔵 Unified Asset Dashboard

- Aggregate and display fungible token balances across Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, Avalanche, Polygon, and Polkadot.
- Provide real-time updates and portfolio valuation.
- Support wallet integrations for each chain (e.g., Metamask for EVM chains, Phantom for Solana, Keplr for Cosmos, and Polkadot.js for Polkadot).

### 🔵 ZK-Enabled Privacy

- Prove ownership of tokens across chains without revealing exact balances using ZKPs.
- Generate proofs for eligibility or threshold balances (e.g., “User owns at least 100 SOL”).

### 🔵 Cross-Chain Transfers

- Enable fungible token transfers between chains using:
  - **Bridges** for EVM and Solana.
  - **IBC** for Cosmos.
  - **XCMP/XCM** for Polkadot.
- Handle bridging complexity seamlessly through backend services.

### 🔵 Built for Developers

- Entire stack built in **Rust**, showcasing a professional-grade, modular, and scalable architecture.
- Designed to be extensible: adding new chains or proof types involves minimal effort.

```

### Backend (Rust)

The backend is implemented entirely in Rust, designed to handle data aggregation, cryptographic computations, and cross-chain communication efficiently and securely.

#### Responsibilities

- Fetching token balances from multiple blockchain ecosystems.
- Aggregating and storing cross-chain token data in a secure database.
- Generating zero-knowledge proofs to validate user requests without revealing sensitive data.
- Managing communication and transactions for cross-chain interoperability, including bridging and message relaying.

#### Core Technologies

- **API Frameworks:** Axum for building REST APIs, providing high performance and async support.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing user sessions, token balances, and cached blockchain states.
- **Cryptographic Libraries:** Arkworks and Halo2 for designing and verifying zero-knowledge proof circuits.
- **Blockchain Interaction Crates:**
  - `solana-client`: For querying Solana RPC nodes and submitting transactions.
  - `ethers-rs`: For interacting with EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon.
  - `cosmrs`: For querying Cosmos chains and creating IBC messages.
  - `substrate-api-client`: For interacting with Polkadot and its parachains.
- **Bridging Protocols:** Wormhole, LayerZero, and Axelar for cross-chain transfers and messaging.
- **Logging:** `tracing` for structured logging and Prometheus-compatible libraries for metrics collection.
- **Asynchronous Runtime:** Tokio for handling concurrency across blockchain networks.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs are foundational to the privacy-preserving features of ZK-Port.

#### Key Concepts

- **Privacy-First Validation:** Ensuring that sensitive information, such as exact token balances, is not exposed during proof generation.
- **Circuit Design:** Leveraging Rust-based libraries to construct modular, efficient ZK circuits capable of threshold and aggregation proofs.
- **Efficiency Focus:** Optimized circuit design minimizes computation and on-chain verification costs while maintaining scalability.

#### ZK Flow

1. **Request Initialization:** A user submits a transfer or validation request.
2. **Data Fetching:** The backend securely queries balances or state information from the relevant blockchains.
3. **Proof Generation:** A ZK proof is generated using cryptographic libraries, validating the requested condition (e.g., balance threshold).
4. **Verification:** The proof is either verified on-chain or relayed to the target chain for further action.

### Cross-Chain Integrations

#### Ethereum/Avalanche/Polygon (EVM-Compatible)

Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche are integrated as EVM-compatible chains, leveraging existing token standards and bridging solutions. Token balances are aggregated using secure RPC endpoints.

#### Solana

Solana’s high-throughput ecosystem is connected via custom Rust-based programs, enabling efficient bridging and state validation.

#### Cosmos

Cosmos inter-chain communication is facilitated using IBC protocols, relaying token information and enabling secure transfers between chains.

#### Polkadot

Polkadot’s Substrate-based chains are integrated through XCMP/XCM, with future support planned for trust-minimized light client verification.
